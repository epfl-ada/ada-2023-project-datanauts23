# The Road to Adminship: A Guide for Aspiring Wikipedia Administrators


## Abstract: 
Wikipedia relies on volunteer administrators for maintenance. Users seeking administrator status submit a Request for Adminship (RFA). The Wikipedia community then decides whether to accept or to reject a given candidate through public discussions involving comments and votes. 
Our project aims to provide individuals interested in the Wikipedia administrator role with a guide for a successful election. To achieve this, we analyze the Wikipedia adminship election data spanning from 2003 to 2013, with a specific focus on identifying patterns that impact election outcomes. We examine comments related to those elections to extract the conditions on which users base their votes. Furthermore, by analyzing the network voting graph, we check for user groups, who consistently support or oppose the same candidates or engage in mutual support, to uncover their roles in shaping the communityâ€™s decisions. 
We combine all these insights to build a roadmap that assists potential candidates in navigating the path towards Adminship.


## Research Questions:

Our project aims to explore the following research questions:
-  How does affinity influence election outcomes, and are there certain votes that carry more weight than others?
-  How does a candidate's prior engagement in the election process affect their chance of success in his election?
-  Do voters leave comments consistent with their voting choices and which factors do they usually take into account when voting?
-  To what extent does the involvement of active members in a specific election contribute to the success of a candidate?
-  How does the large number of neutral votes impact the acceptance or rejection of a candidate?


## Additional Datasets:

Since our objective is to analyze the factors behind people's voting choices, we need metrics to evaluate the productivity of users. For that, we use additional datasets containing statistics about Wikipedia users, precisely: 

-  The number of pages created per user: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Bryan/List_of_users_by_pages_created <br>
-  The number of articles per user : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_Wikipedians_by_article_count <br>
-  The number of edits per user: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_Wikipedians_by_number_of_edits <br>
